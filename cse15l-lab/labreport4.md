For the lab report this week, reproduce the task from above on your own. For each numbered step starting right after the timer (so steps 4-9), take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step. For special characters like <enter> or <tab>, write them in angle brackets with code formatting. Then, summarize the commands you ran and what the effect of those keypresses were.

For example, when you run the tests, you might want to use the up arrow or Ctrl-R to access your bash history rather than typing in the full command with classpath, etc. You might say something like this accompanying the screenshot for running the tests:

## Step 4. Log into ieng6

The 22 keys that were pressed were 
> s s h `<space>` j 1 t y @ i e n 6 . u c s d . e d u 

The command that I ran was intended for me, the user, to remotely access and manage the system of a remote computer. The effects of the those key presses were intended to call the `ssh` command and afterwards providing the username and hostname of the remote system you want to connect to, or `user@host-name`. There is no such preexisting call of the command in the bash history so my bash history was not used for this step.

## Step 5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL)

The 12 keys that were pressed were
> g i t `<space>` c l o n e `<space>` `<Control-V>`

The command that I ran was intended for me to create a fork of the repository from my Github account. The effects of the these key presses were to call the git clone command and then afterwards paste the SSH link that I copied from Github. Utilizing copying and pasting is an extremely convenient tool that is intended to speed up the process rather than typing it word-for-word, letter-by-letter. As opposed to constantly referring back to Github to find out what characters are used for the SSH link, I can simply copy and paste the link unto the terminal. 

## Step 6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail


## Step 7. Edit the code file to fix the failing test


## Step 8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed


## Step 8. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)
